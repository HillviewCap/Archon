# Phase 5 Implementation Progress & Roadmap

This document tracks the progress of implementing the Phase 5 hierarchical RAG retrieval strategy as outlined in `docs/Phase5.md`.

## Completed Steps (Basic Semantic Retrieval Flow)

The foundational end-to-end flow for **semantic retrieval** has been implemented across the core components in `archon/llms_txt/retrieval/`:

1.  **Query Processing (`QueryProcessor`):**
    *   Initialized `OpenAIEmbeddingGenerator`.
    *   Implemented `generate_embeddings` using the embedder.
    *   Implemented basic `detect_path_query` (checking for ">" or "/").
    *   Implemented `process_query` to return original query, embedding, and path flag.

2.  **Core Search (`RetrievalManager._perform_search`):**
    *   Implemented logic to call the `match_hierarchical_nodes` SQL function via the `search_client` (`SupabaseManager`).
    *   Accepts `query_embedding` and `match_count`.
    *   Returns raw node results sorted by similarity from the database.

3.  **Ranking (`HierarchicalRanker.rerank_results`):**
    *   Implemented basic pass-through logic, relying on the database's initial similarity sorting.
    *   Added placeholder `rerank_score` based on similarity.
    *   Cleaned up unused placeholder scoring methods (added `pass`).

4.  **Response Building (`ResponseBuilder.build_response`):**
    *   Implemented basic formatting logic.
    *   Extracts key fields (`id`, `path`, `title`, `content`, `score`) from results.
    *   Creates content snippets.
    *   Returns a list of simplified result dictionaries.
    *   Cleaned up unused placeholder helper methods (added `pass`).

5.  **Orchestration (`RetrievalManager.retrieve`):**
    *   Implemented the sequence: `process_query` -> `_perform_search` (for semantic) -> `rerank_results` -> `build_response`.
    *   Includes conditional logic for semantic vs. path queries (path logic is currently a placeholder).
    *   Stores intermediate results in `debug_info`.

6.  **Integration (`run_processing.py`):**
    *   The `--test-query` argument now correctly instantiates `RetrievalManager` with `SupabaseManager` and invokes the basic semantic retrieval flow.

7.  **Cleanup:**
    *   Removed redundant `run_retrieval.py` and `example_usage.py` scripts.

## Remaining Tasks & Next Steps

With the basic semantic flow established, the following tasks remain to complete the Phase 5 implementation:

1.  **Implement Path-Based Search:**
    *   **Priority:** High (Next Step)
    *   **Goal:** Handle queries directly referencing document paths.
    *   **Action:** Modify `RetrievalManager` to use the `find_nodes_by_path` SQL function when `is_path_query` is true.

2.  **Enhance Ranking (`HierarchicalRanker`):**
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Goal:** Improve result relevance beyond basic similarity.
    *   **Action:** Implement placeholder scoring methods (`score_hierarchical_relevance`, `score_path_matching`, `score_content_type_match`, etc.) and combine scores in `rerank_results`.

3.  **Refine Response Building (`ResponseBuilder`):**
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Goal:** Provide richer, context-aware responses.
    *   **Action:** Implement logic using `get_node_with_context` to fetch context, extract citations, identify related sections, and format as structured markdown.

4.  **Improve Query Processing (`QueryProcessor`):**
    *   **Priority:** Low/Medium
    *   **Goal:** Handle queries more intelligently.
    *   **Action:** Implement hybrid query variations and more sophisticated context extraction.

5.  **Evaluation & Testing:**
    *   **Priority:** High (after core features are implemented)
    *   **Goal:** Measure performance and ensure quality.
    *   **Action:** Implement the evaluation framework (`utils/evaluation.py`) and conduct tests based on Steps 8 & 9 of `docs/Phase5.md`.
